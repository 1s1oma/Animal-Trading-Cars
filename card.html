			<p>Honeybees live in colonies with one queen running the whole hive.
				Worker honeybees are all females and are the only bees most people ever see flying around outside of the hive.
				Drone honeybees are all males. They live to mate with the queen.
				Honeybees are disappearing from hives due to colony collapse disorder</p>
